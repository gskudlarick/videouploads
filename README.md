![alt text](https://help.github.com/assets/images/site/be-social.gif)

## Test URLS


* **Server Side Rendering** - http://159.203.192.45:8080/
* **username/password** - *api  api100*
* **Angular Client**- http://159.203.192.45/vz/ 
* **UPLOADED ASSETS** -       
  * My DigitalOcean Server. I Didnt'have tiem to set up AWS S3*
  * https://exsracing.com/vz/ASSETS/
  *   https://exsracing.com/vz/ASSETS/HLS/


## To Build and Run the project

* In a terminal window:.
``` sh
  >mkdir my-proj
  >git clone  https://github.com/gskudlarick/videouploads.git
  >cd my-proj
```
 * Setup mysql db.   https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/#mysql-getting-started-installing
   * Install mamp for quick setup:  https://www.mamp.info/en/
 * Run the *sql.ddl* in src/main/resources
 * Update *application.properties* file for db connection and directories.
``` sh
  >mvn clean package
  >java -jar target/gs-securing-web-0.1.0.java
```
 * Test at   __http://localhost:8080__
 
 
 ## Features to Implement
 - [x] **Clean UI with bootstrap**
  - [ ] **Refactor Java Code**
   * Re- Organize File Structure.  Make File Copy into Reusable Service,  Add Proptreis for Messages.
 - [ ] **Add File Upload Progress Bar** *Technique: Add 2nd Servlet/Rest Client with Progress info for Ajax Calls*
  * **Technique 1 Progress Endpoint** Implement ProgressListener and override update() with a  HttpSession attribute with the status %
    * Use Apache Commons FileUpload package
    * Create a new Rest endpoint to return the % value in the HttpSession attribute
    * Create a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest ajax call on window.setInterva(2000)
    * implement callback method to get  % from Restpoint
    * Update the % on a bootstrap DOM progress bar element.
    * Try the newer XHR. ProgressEvent onProgress() and see what kind of data it sends back for multi-part
  * **Technique 2 Web Sockets** Use Java API for WebSocket (JSR 356) to communicate with JavaScript Client Pop up
    * Similar to chat implementation.  Use JavaScript WebSockets Api on client side.  Jquery Popup, or Angular.
 * **Technique 3 Job/Workflow Service** Create Data driven Job Service.  
    *  **Scales for large jobs**, which can run in background,  then update client status via messaging. (email, txt, websocket etc.) 
    * Server updates jobs_tbl, and workflow_table in DB.  Uses workflow_id, job_id.
    * File Upload Controller creates a new job for Video Prcessing.
    * File Upload Controler creates a Workflow with the following steps:  
      1.  file upload 
      2.  ffprobe get file status 
      3.  thumbs generation  
      4.  poster generation
      5.  HLS processing
    * Server updates status via WebSocket API
    * Client uses Javascript WebSockets API, and updaet widget, with progress bars for each step in the workflow
    
 - [ ] **Figure out how to pipe the File Upload multi-part Stream to the ffprobe input**
  * This way we don't have to Upload the file to run ffprobe and get the duration info.
    * Shortcut would be to limit file size using **spring.http.multipart.max-request-size=128MB**
   * Break out the FileUpload Steam to somehow write to this new Stream opened by ffprobe
   * Figure out how to  configure ffprobe to read from a STDIN File Descripter, and get Java to wrote to it.
  - [ ] **Add swagger Documentation, and JavaDoc**
 - [ ] **Update Security**
    * Currrently uses Basic Authentication.  Modify to use form based using JWT tokens
     * Currently does not encrypt password. Add Login Form and use Use *BCryptPasswordEncoder()*.
     * Update code in *WebSecurityConfig* to update  *config(HttpSecurity)...* and *CorsFilter.java*
     * Test and ensure CORS, CSRF working and locked down for Rest Clients.  
 - [ ] **Update UI Video Player to Play Uploaded Videos and Thumbs**
   * I Customized the json output from the transcoding process to work with videojs-thumbnails plugin. https://www.npmjs.com/package/videojs-thumbnails
   * e.g. https://exsracing.com/vz/ASSETS/trailer_thumbs.json
   * I have this working on another site. http://testplayer.crackle.com/thumbs/chucky2.html **Test the Scrubbing**
   * It would take me about 4 hours to add some HTML Drop Down controls to Select from uploaded Videos and implement on the test Site.

### JSON for Custom Thumbnmail processing.  
**Specifies the paramaters of which section of the Sprite to show for video time interval**, e.g. 0, 10, 20, 
```json  
   {

  "0": {
    "src": "trailer_sprite.jpg",
    "style": {
      "width": "300px",
